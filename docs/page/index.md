# Overview
> A document string minor mode.

This package provides a simple solution for the insertion of documentation strings into code.

## Usage

You can enable this package for a specific major mode:

```el
;; Enable `docstr' inside these major modes.
(add-hook 'actionscript-mode-hook (lambda () (docstr-mode 1)))
(add-hook 'java-mode-hook (lambda () (docstr-mode 1)))
```

Or if you just want to enable it inside a specific buffer just call `docstr-mode` as a command through the minibuffer:

```
M-x docstr-mode
```

You can also enable this package in all buffers via:

```el
(global-docstr-mode 1)
```

## Supported Languages

Here is a list of all languages that are supported by this package:

* ActionScript
* C / C++ / C#
* Golang / Groovy
* Java / JavaScript / JSX
* Lua
* Objective-C
* PHP / Python
* Ruby / Rust
* Scala / Swift
* TypeScript

You can customize the `docstr-writers-alist` variable to add your own documentation string support for your favourite language. Just add a cons cell like `(mode-name . docstr-writer-name)`.

To create your own documentation string writer, you need to create a function that takes in one argument. For instance:

```el
(defun my-docstr-writer (search-string)
  ;; Insert documentation string here.
  )
```

The argument `search-string` will then be populated by the appropriate trigger function in `docstr-trigger-alist`. See the variable `docstr-trigger-alist` for more information. For instance, a `C#` trigger could look like this:

```el
("/" . docstr-trigger-csharp)
```

And the trigger function could look like this:

```el
(defun docstr-trigger-csharp (&rest _)
  "Trigger document string inside C#."
  (when (and (docstr--doc-valid-p) (looking-back "///" 3))
    (save-excursion
      (insert " <summary>\n")
      (insert "/// \n")
      (insert "/// </summary>"))
    (forward-line 1)
    (end-of-line)
    (docstr--insert-doc-string (docstr--c-style-search-string 2))))
```

In this example, docstring insertion is triggered only when certain conditions are met; the function `docstr--insert-doc-string` will be called last of all to insert the actual docstring content. `(docstr--c-style-search-string 2)` is the `search-string` passed on to the documentation string writer which writes a proper documentation string based on its information.

## Before/After Insertion

You can customize documentation before or after the docstring insertion.

There are two hooks you can customize:

* `docstr-before-insert-hook`
* `docstr-after-insert-hook`

The use case of this is to provide some kind of set up. For instance, some programming languages would add `@desc` before an actual description. The following would implement this:

```el
(add-hook 'docstr-before-insert-hook (lambda (search-string) (insert "@desc ")))
```

Of course, I would recommend you add it locally so it is language specific. Let's try to apply only to `TypeScript` and only within `typescript-mode`:

```el
(defun my-typescript-mode-hook ()
  (add-hook 'docstr-before-insert-hook
            (lambda (search-string) (insert "@desc "))
            nil t))

(add-hook 'typescript-mode-hook #'my-typescript-mode-hook)
```

## Advanced Implementation

You can also customize documentation strings by running `before`/`after` hooks. The following are advanced examples for documentation strings in `C++`:

| Preprocessor                          | Enumerator                          |
|:--------------------------------------|:------------------------------------|
| <img src="./etc/c++/cpp-define.gif"/> | <img src="./etc/c++/cpp-enum.gif"/> |

| Structure                             | Class                                |
|:--------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------|

## Documentation Strings

You can customize default documentation strings by tweaking these variables.

### Type Name

* `docstr-format-type` - default: `"{ %s }"`

The default is wrap around curly brackets. It only takes one `%s` for the type name.

* `docstr-show-type-name` - default: `t`

If you don't want the type name to be shown; then setting `docstr-show-type-name` to `nil` will do the trick. For instance, if you don't want the type name to be shown in `java-mode` do the following.

```el
(add-hook 'java-mode-hook (lambda () (setq-local docstr-show-type-name nil)))
```

* `docstr-default-typename` - default: `typename`

You can change this value if you don't like the default type name. This variable is generally used for programming languages that aren't statically typed like `Python`, `JavaScript`, `PHP`, etc.

### Variable Name

* `docstr-format-var` - default: `"%s :"`

The default is having a colon `:` at the back of the variable name. It only takes one `%s` for the variable name.

### Parameter & Return

* `docstr-format-param` - default: `@param #T##V##D#`
* `docstr-format-return` - default: `@return #T##V##D#`

You can customize these variables for different documentation styles. See the following table for the desciption of the keys `#T#`, `#V#` and `#D#`:

| Key   | Description                  |
|:------|:-----------------------------|
| `#T#` | Key represent type name.     |
| `#V#` | Key represent variable name. |
| `#D#` | Key represent description.   |

*P.S. These variables are constant.*

### Default Descriptions

Here is a list of default description strings that you can customize. These strings are placeholders to remind you to replace these strings with content descriptions.

* `docstr-desc-summary` - default to `"[summary]"`.
* `docstr-desc-param` - default to `"[description]"`.
* `docstr-desc-return` - default to `"[description]"`.
* `docstr-desc-typename` - default to `"[type]"`.

## Faces Configuration

This package provides a way to customize the document string faces in a consistent way, though this is an optional choice. To enable this feature, you can put the following code snippet into your configuration:

```el
(docstr-faces-apply)
```

There are three faces that you can customize for documentation strings:

* `docstr-faces-tag-face` - Highlight the tag face; like `@param`, `@return`, etc.
* `docstr-faces-type-face` - Highlight the type name face.
* `docstr-faces-value-face` - Highlight the variable name face.

## Multiline Docstrings & Keys

Make sure you have starting and ending comments before triggering documentation string insertion using this package. For instance, you will need `/*` and `*/` before hitting return. There are several packages that can help you achieve this. You can also enable variable `docstr-key-support` for the built-in support from this package.

```el
;; This fixes auto pairing for documentation strings which fulfill conditions
;; from the multiline documentation string trigger.
(setq docstr-key-support t)
```
