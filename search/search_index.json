Just add a cons cell like (mode-name . docstr-writer-name) . To create your own documentation string writer, you need to create a function that takes in one argument. For instance: (defun my-docstr-writer (search-string) ;; Insert documentation string here. ) The argument search-string will then be populated by the appropriate trigger function in docstr-trigger-alist . See the variable docstr-trigger-alist for more information. For instance, a C# trigger could look like this: (\"/\" . docstr-trigger-csharp) And the trigger function could look like this: (defun docstr-trigger-csharp (&rest _) \"Trigger document string inside C#.\" (when (and (docstr--doc-valid-p) (looking-back \"///\" 3)) (save-excursion (insert \" <summary>\\n\") (insert \"/// \\n\") (insert \"/// </summary>\")) (forward-line 1) (end-of-line) (docstr--insert-doc-string (docstr--c-style-search-string 2)))) In this example, docstring insertion is triggered only when certain conditions are met; the function docstr--insert-doc-string will be called last of all to insert the actual docstring content. (docstr--c-style-search-string 2) is the search-string passed on to the documentation string writer which writes a proper documentation string based on its information. Before/After Insertion # You can customize documentation before or after the docstring insertion. There are two hooks you can customize: docstr-before-insert-hook docstr-after-insert-hook The use case of this is to provide some kind of set up. For instance, some programming languages would add @desc before an actual description. The following would implement this: (add-hook 'docstr-before-insert-hook (lambda (search-string) (insert \"@desc \"))) Of course, I would recommend you add it locally so it is language specific. Let's try to apply only to TypeScript and only within typescript-mode : (defun my-typescript-mode-hook () (add-hook 'docstr-before-insert-hook (lambda (search-string) (insert \"@desc \")) nil t)) (add-hook 'typescript-mode-hook #'my-typescript-mode-hook) Advanced Implementation # You can also customize documentation strings by running before / after hooks.

It only takes one %s for the type name. docstr-show-type-name - default: t If you don't want the type name to be shown; then setting docstr-show-type-name to nil will do the trick. For instance, if you don't want the type name to be shown in java-mode do the following.
